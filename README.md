# Confocal-z-stack-cell-detection
 To facilitate repeatable, robust, and rapid analysis of a large number of confocal images of cells, we generated an open source automated image analysis pipeline that detects and quantifies cells in brightfield and/or fluorescent confocal z-stack images. The pipeline can be run through an R Shiny graphical user interface (GUI).
